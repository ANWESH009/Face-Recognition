# Face-Recognition
This was one of my projects thatv involved face recognition that involved use of opencv library and dlib module. Studying the various aspects of face recognition and the basics of image processing
algorithms helped me to develop this project. There are many algorithms used for face recognition and found this one a unique way to approach this topic.
Tis can be implemented in various security system , raspberry pi projects , scanning markers and also as an attendance system.
